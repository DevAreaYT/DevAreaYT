## 🌼 What is DevArea?

**DevArea** is a public code notebook.  
Whenever I build something for a video, short, reel, or demo — the code comes here.

Think of this repo as:
- 📦 a storage box for useful snippets  
- 🧩 small projects you can understand quickly  
- 🔁 code you can reuse without stress  

---

## 🧠 Why this exists

Most beginners struggle because:
- tutorials hide files  
- repos are over-engineered  
- nothing works out-of-the-box  

DevArea tries to fix that.

- simple folder structure  
- minimal setup  
- readable code  
- practical purpose  

---

## 🛠️ What you’ll mostly see

- HTML / CSS / JS mini projects  
- UI effects & hover animations  
- automation & helper scripts  
- small tools made for creators  
- experiments that *actually work*

Nothing fancy. Everything useful.

## 🐣 How to use the code
Open, read, break it, fix it, make it yours.

💚 Small note

You don’t need permission to learn.
You don’t need money to start.
You just need working examples.

That’s what DevArea is for.
